  <h2><u>History of Game Station</u></h2>
  <img src="images/arcade.jpg" alt="View of the Store" style="width:40%;height:auto">
  <p>Game Station was founded on March 21st, 2022 by Alexander Mertsch.</p>
  <p>Mertsch was always an avid gamer ever since he was a young boy and has been very passionate about his hobby ever since.</p>
  <p>When Mertsch grew up, he got his first job at a retail store, which over time would inspire him to open his own, albiet more specialized.</p>
  <p>His vision was quite simple, he wanted his store to feel more than just another video game retailer, he wanted to be a gamer's paraside.</p>
  <p>Ever since then, Game Station has been booming throughout Virginia and many other states.</p>
